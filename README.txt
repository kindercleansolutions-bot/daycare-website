KinderClean Solutions - Static Website
======================================

This package contains a ready-to-deploy static website tailored for KinderClean Solutions.

Files:
- index.html, services.html, deep.html, about.html, contact.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/logo.png (your uploaded logo)

How to deploy (Netlify - FREE):
1. Sign up for Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) and log in.
2. From the Netlify dashboard, click "Sites" -> "Add new site" -> "Deploy manually".
3. Drag & drop the contents of the folder (all files and the 'assets' folder) into Netlify.
4. Netlify will publish the site and provide a free subdomain like 'kinderclean-solutions.netlify.app'.
5. To use your custom domain (kindercleansolutions.ca):
   - Purchase the domain at a registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains).
   - In your Netlify site settings, go to "Domain management" -> "Add custom domain" and enter 'kindercleansolutions.ca'.
   - Follow Netlify's DNS setup instructions (usually add A records or use Netlify DNS).
   - Netlify will provision SSL automatically (Let's Encrypt).

Netlify Forms:
- The contact form on contact.html uses Netlify Forms. After deployment, form submissions will appear in the Netlify dashboard (Forms).

If you'd like, I can:
- Provide step-by-step screenshots for connecting your domain.
- Suggest registrars with low first-year pricing.
- Configure DNS values you can paste into your registrar.
